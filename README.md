# CSCI-Lab-6

Name: Murr the Seal

Objective: Make a game with AI steering for both objects that you need to collect (or eat) and objects that you need to avoid (sharks).

Narrative: You play as Murr, a very hungry seal who has to go through three different levels and eat fish while avoiding the sharks!

Mechanics: Use A/D to change direction, and W to move forward. Press left shift while moving forward to jump/dash!

Aesthetics: Top-down, 2D pixel art.

Joys and Struggles: Getting the balance right with the AI steering fish was very tricky. For a long time they ran away way too fast, and it took a while to get them to move at an appropriate speed. But, we were happy with how the animations came out.
